# Solar System (OpenGL & C++)

Project - Computer Graphicsg (145815) - Federico Favia, June 2019, University of Trento, Trento

This project in C++ and OpenGL developed within the course of Computer Graphics at University of Trento shows a demo of the solar system, not in perfect scale but navigable through keyboard, and with textures on the planets (.jpg files in the folder img). 
See the report for more information and a demo video of the project. 
The project makes use of open source library like stb image.h-v2.22, personal code and to make it run you need to follow some tutorials about setting up VisualStudio with OpenGL, GLEW and GLUT libraries. 
You can see some sample images from the final result down here:
